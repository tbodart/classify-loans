# classify-loans

Given a dataset containing information on 50,000 loans with 30 variables, the goal is to use logistic regression to predict which applicants are likely to default on their loans. I will do this by preparing and cleaning the dataset, exploring and transforming the data to eliminate skew, creating and optimizing a logistic model, and reporting my findings.

The final model I suggest, summarized in the executive summary at the top of my `Final_report.rmd`, is based on profit optimization for the bank.
